; Proxy configuration is managed via environment variables so local
; development and CI environments without a corporate proxy continue to
; function.
# Leave proxy-related settings unset so npm defers to environment
# variables when necessary. Explicitly assigning an empty value can
# cause npm to treat the configuration as invalid in newer releases.
