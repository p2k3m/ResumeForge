# Font Awesome Assets

This directory should contain local copies of Font Awesome 6.5.0 files.
Download `css/all.min.css`, `js/all.min.js`, and the contents of the `webfonts/` directory from the official Font Awesome distribution or CDN and place them here.

Placeholders are included because network access was unavailable during setup.
